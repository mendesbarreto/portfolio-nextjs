          With <span className="text-mTeal font-semibold">14 years in software engineering</span>, I&apos;ve worked across the full stack,
          leading and mentoring teams that ship quality products. My focus is on delivering what clients actually need
          by collaborating closely with product and design and ruthlessly trimming down processes. This means practical
          agile, a strong focus on automation, and a culture of high quality.
        </p>
        <p className="text-mGray leading-relaxed mt-4">
          I stay hands-on by architecting systems, managing migrations, and consulting. This keeps my skills sharp
          and helps me understand my team&apos;s challenges.

        <p className="text-mTeal leading-relaxed mt-4 font-semibold">
          My goal is simple: build high-performing teams and scalable solutions that actually work.
